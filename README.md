# Code_from_Macintosh_Programming_Secrets_1988

Code from the first edition of the book "Macintosh Programming Secrets", by Scott Knaster.

The examples are written in Pascal

You can find the first edition on [Vintage Apple - Mac Programming](https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/)

There is also a second edition (1992), which has code examples in C. Repo for that book coming shortly.
